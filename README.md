# cdns

![Build and Test badge](https://github.com/adamdb5/cdns/actions/workflows/build_and_test.yaml/badge.svg)

A simple, DNS message marshalling / unmarshalling library written in C.

Built and tested on Linux and MacOS.

cdns facilitates the marshalling and unmarshalling of DNS messages. 

cdns does not contain any way of sending / receiving messages, instead cdns marshalls the message into a standard DNS data packet.

cdns does not compress any fields.
